### University of Michigan - Program in Computing for the Arts and Sciences

At Michigan, I teach classes on [_Computing's Impact on Justice_](https://guzdial.engin.umich.edu/compfor-111-computings-impact-on-justice-from-text-to-the-web/) and [_Computing for Creative Expression_](https://guzdial.engin.umich.edu/compfor-121-computing-for-creative-expression/). See the links for information on earlier versions of the classes as designed and taught by Mark Guzdial.

The programming component of both classes is taught in [Snap!](https://snap.berkeley.edu/), a graphical programming language developed by Jens MÃ¶nig and hosted by U.C. Berkeley. Snap! is descended from Scratch but is considerably more powerful - you can find sample code from my classes at [my public Snap! page](https://snap.berkeley.edu/user?username=bmllr).

In Fall 2024, I'll be teaching a class called _Synthesis to Streaming: Music in Digital Culture_. We'll program instruments in Max/MSP, consider the impact of streaming on listening practices and political economy, and think about the implications of machine learning and AI for generating and understanding music.

PCAS offers minors in Computing for Expression and Computing for Scientific Discovery. Interested students should check out our [advising page](https://lsa.umich.edu/computingfor/undergraduates/advising.html).

### Previous teaching

At Yale I taught most of the courses in the standard music theory and musicianship sequences as a grad student, and as a lecturer I designed taught a sophomore writing seminar titled _Music in Words: Controversy, critique, invective_.

As a master's student at Kansas, I taught an introductory music technology class from 2012-2014.
