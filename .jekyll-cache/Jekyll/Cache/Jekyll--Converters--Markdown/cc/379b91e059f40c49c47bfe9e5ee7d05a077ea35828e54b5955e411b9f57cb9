<p>Since my employment isn’t tied to research output these days, my reading has been particularly unfocused (more professionally: “wide-ranging”). I’ve generally done a poor job of keeping track of this kind of thing, so I’m experimenting with maintaining a list and making it public. The list is focused on academic readings, but I’ll also include non-academic stuff that’s either related to my work, particularly good, or of interest for whatever reason.</p>

<p>Under construction warning: a lot of the citations are messy and incomplete at the moment.</p>
