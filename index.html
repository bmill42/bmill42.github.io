<div class="blurb">

    <p>I'm a lecturer in the <a href="https://lsa.umich.edu/computingfor">Program in Computing for the Arts and Sciences</a> at the University of Michigan, where I teach classes on critical computing and computing in the arts. I've previously worked as a data scientist at the Institute for Social Research at U-M and taught in the department of music at Yale.</p>

    <p>As a music scholar I'm interested in the role of computing in musical theory and practice, from the postwar intellectual history of music theory to attempts to get computers to improvise and generate music.</p>

    <p>More generally, I really like semiotics, Adorno, greyhounds, and tennis.</p>
