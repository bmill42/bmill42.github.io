			<h1>About</h1>
			<p>I am a music scholar specializing in the recent history of music theory, particularly the postwar reception of ideas from information theory and cybernetics as exemplified in Leonard Meyer's theory of musical style. In my dissertation, this historical work leads to a close engagement with, and critique of, recent practices in data-driven computational music theory, also known as corpus studies. Some of my forthcoming articles and book chapters consider topics ranging from the semiotics of musical Markov models to robots that play jazz.</p>
			<p>More generally, I'm interested in a broad range of humanistic thought as it intersects with music and sound, including media theory and the philosophy of technology, critical approaches to Big Data, sound studies, and music of the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries. I also have an interest in Adorno's philosophy of music, and have written on his treatment of the concept of style in his little-studied <i>Towards a Theory of Musical Reproduction</i>.</p>
